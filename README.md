# Connected-A-Social-Network
A social networking app that allows you to connect with friends and family across the globe.

## Overview 
Connected is a social networking app that allows the user to view their profile, update their profile information and view a feed that shares posts from friends and family.

## 1. Research 
Before jumping into designing, I first brainstormed applications that were already widely used and accessed by different communities. Applications like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Linkedin, and others were known for being successful in creating fostering relationships despite distance, language barriers, etc. They all shared factors that made them easy to gravitate towards: 
- Clean imagery
- Clear copy
- Ease of access 
When brainstorming how to execute my own application, I wanted to keep these factors in mind. 

## 2. Design Process 
I created user profiles to align with design considerations I had for making a inclusive-focused app.

***How might someone who is completely new to the app interact with the different components?***
- Dana is 26 years old and has recently decided that she would like to create a social media account to meet new people especially artists to share and critique her work. She is familiar with popular social media apps but does not have an account.
***How might someone who requires accessibility features interact with the different components?***
- Ricardo is 35 years old and uses a screen reader to interact with social media. He is familiar with the basic upload components found in most apps. He is seeking an app that allows him to connect with friends and family on a day to day basis through writing and photos.

***How might someone who is a social media guru interact with different components?***
- Amira is an 18 yo socialite who loves using social media to connect with her fans from other platforms.She likes to take stylistic pphotos of hersel. She also assists sponsors with ad content and strategy to boost sales and commissions.
